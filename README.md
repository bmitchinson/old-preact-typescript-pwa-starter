    - `tsc` in watch mode with `preact watch` works great + includes sass changes.

`npm i -g typescript preact-cli@2.2.1`
- Run `npm watch` to start a development server. (`-p PORT`)

By default, `.js` and `*js.map` files will be disabled from the file
explorer in vscode. Simply edit the `.vscode/settings.json` file to edit these defaults.
